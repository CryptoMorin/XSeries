            // different information about the same thing.
            // ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            // The statement "lock.lock()"
            // needs to be called as the first statement before literally anything else, otherwise
            // the cache will fail and attempt to cache the same key twice. To reproduce this, you
            // can simply put a random statement before this (can be reproduced by XSkullRequestQueueTest
            // which will occasionally fail, so you might have to test 2-3 times), for example:
            // {
            // try {
            //     Thread.sleep(1000);
            // } catch (InterruptedException e) {

            // lock.lock();
            // }
            // However there is another way to fix this other than forcing the lock as the first statement,
            // and it's that we should always return a ReferentialKeyedLock instead of NulledKeyedLock directly
            // for the first lock.
            // This issue happens because other threads might lock it faster than the one which requested it,
            // so the raw NulledKeyedLock should belong to them but since the pendingTasks check was done here,
            // it'll be used for the first request.
            //
            // Note that the cache will still be null in very rare cases after the first request cached it.
            // This could be because we use a normal HashMap (for the cache which is referenced by the fetcher function,
            // not the map that holds the locks in this class) which is not thread-safe, but we're already
            // synchronizing the keys, so this might be because of some internal rehashing that is happening
            // which causes this incompatibility. However, the chances of this happening is very, very small in
            // most cases (almost 1 out of 100,000 requests) that is not worth the performance sacrifice of
            // using Collections.synchronizedMap() or ConcurrentHashMap.
            // These results have been confirmed by many repeated iterations of XSkullRequestQueueTest.
